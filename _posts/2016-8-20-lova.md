LOVA builds her music off the thoughts she writes down on her diary and presents six tracks with simple and sharp lyrics that show her as boldly as she is. A young woman with clear ideas on her individuality and independence, her personality and how not to please others, always giving space to her own insecurities and emotional slumps. She conveys an empowering message throughout Scripted Reality that is musically displayed with catchy pop melody games.
