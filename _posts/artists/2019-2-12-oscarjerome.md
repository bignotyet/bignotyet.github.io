You may have heard about the acclaimed West-African-influenced jazz collective KOKOROKO, but you may not be aware of the as well engaging solo project of their talented guitarist. *Oscar Jerome* started playing classical guitar by the age of 8, and his genre influences have broaden to jazz, hip-hop, afrobeat and more since. His gripping lyrics go hand in hand with the diverse music style of each track - may them be political claims or personal inner observations, he always shares them in the form of a hip and honest sound that goes beyond the traditional jazz label.
