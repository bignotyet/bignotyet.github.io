Musicians, poets and Dubliners in equal parts. They used to meet up to share their poetry as college Literature students, thus getting to know each otherâ€™s minds deeply. By turning this experience into their composition approach, **Fontaines D.C.** maintain their focus on the lyrics and accompany them with elegant hypnotic punk rock played all out. Underground Dublin remains the main influence in their artistry, even placing referential city-characters as the cover of some of their EPs. Proud of the imperfectly perfect city they grew up in, the ambitious band wants their music to keep us in a trance.
