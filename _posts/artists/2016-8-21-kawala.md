Daniel McCarthy and Jim Higson met at Leeds College of Music and decided to drop out together in order to start a band. **KAWALA** is the result, and its music will take you to this sunny paradise where life is suddenly easy, relax and problem-free. Nature is quite present in their lyrics and it also feels itâ€™s the place where their songs should be played at. The 5 tracks released so far will be enough to make you admire their harmonies, enjoy their guitar picking and get their sweet melodies stuck in your head.
