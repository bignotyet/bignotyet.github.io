She started going to clubs only a few months ago, but her tracks totally fit as immediate youthful hits to fancy at the dancefloor.

Inspired by simple everyday facts -from a visit to a museum to Trumpâ€™s world-changing election-, Millie expresses euphoric hopefulness through intended lyrics and a simple sound production.
