A bedroom, rhythm, psychedelic jams and fuzz. These are the four main ingredients to make a proper Space Carbonara. Their music is going to make you travel around a world where emotions take living form and walk next to you. Australia has hidden gems. This is one of them. Coming from a small suburb in NSWâ€™s Central Coast, Space Carbonara show how intense the scene is between Newcastle and Sydney.
