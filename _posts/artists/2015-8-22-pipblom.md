Pip started writing on her own until she found herself in need of a band that could play her songs live. Her brother (and two other musicians) joined in and **Pip Blom** became a band. Their frontwoman may look shy but she is actually confident about the kind of music she wants to play and how to play it - she still writes every part and sends it to her band so that they can readjust. With no intention to release an album yet, the lo-fi guitars and soft vocals in their EP *Paycheck* (2018) will keep you pleased for now.
