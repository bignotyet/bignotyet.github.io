Aged just 21, **Amanda Tenfjord** is already a promising artist. Besides having Greek roots, she grew up in a Norwegian town called Tennfjord –such a coincidence taking into account her surname– and now she’s based in Trondheim. Her music might remind you to the likes of **Sigrid** or **Aurora**: it’s not surprising then to discover that the three artists have collaborated with producer Askjell Solstrand. Others even compare her with **London Grammar** or **Adele**.
