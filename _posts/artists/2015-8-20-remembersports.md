They have released their third album, *Slow Buzz* (2018), which apparently makes them feel they’ve grown old. Don’t believe that - **Remember Sports**‘s original aura can be felt in every song. Carmen Perry’s voice exposing her explicit personal lyrics and the rapid drums that follow her are the right addiction to keep you forever young. We’ll call it intelligent noise to be screamed out loud in your favourite small venue. You should not miss them.
