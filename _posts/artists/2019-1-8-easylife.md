They all had belonged to swing, jazz, funk, reggae and hip-hop bands before, and every part of the mishmash is remarkable in their musical approach. **Easy Life** is consistent to its name and introduces simple and catchy melodies that allow you to appreciate pleasure in life, even if itâ€™s through ironic lyrics describing an actual bittersweet world. Passion for music is the only aim behind their charming musical fusion, and with no further aspiration for now the effort is paying off quite well.
