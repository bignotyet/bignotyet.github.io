24 European artists were nominated for the **Music Moves Europe Talent Awards** (former EBBA Awards) at the Reeperbahn Festival last September. This annual prize implemented by **Eurosonic Noorderslag (ESNS)** awards those upcoming artists that represent the ‘European sound of today and tomorrow’ and provides them a training program and financial support for touring and promotion, besides the inherent visibilization that obtaining an award entails. 

The 12 winners -two for each category- from 10 different countries have now been announced and will be presented at the opening night of ESNS 2019, on January 16th. Here’s our favourite act from each genre.

## ALBIN LEE MELDAU
### SWEDEN | SINGER/SONGWRITER
Already winner of the first-ever Anchor Award back in Reeperbahn 2016, which recognised him as a promising international artist to follow. Two years afterwards he’s proving it with his debut album *About You* (2018). Raw soul stories played by Albin’s powerful broken voice worthy of a 60s vocalist.

## BISHOP BRIGGS
### UK | POP
Raised in Japan and Hong Kong and graduated in Los Angeles, singer behind **Bishop Briggs** shows up her perseverance in life through the raw beats of her songs. Her soulful voice provides extra emotion to these personal lyrics shrud in dark atmospheres, and she gladly encourages us to be part of them.

## PIP BLOM
### THE NETHERLANDS | ROCK
We have to admit we like the first songs she wrote on her own back in 2016 better than the last ones released on her *Paycheck* EP. Yet **Pip Blom**’s sound will certainly be hopeful for those lo-fi grungy guitar lovers. She didn’t want people thinking she would play ‘cute music’ just because she’s a blonde girl. She’s definitely proving it right.

## REYKYAVÍKURDAETUR
### ICELAND | HIP-HOP/RAP
It’s no surprise we can’t understand a word in their lyrics, but that is not a problem to completely fall in love with the project of this Icelandic female rap collective. A forceful sound that suggests anger but also confidence about what they’re doing. 11 members sharing solos, duos, and trios as a true gang. Can’t wait to see them live.

## ROSALÍA
### SPAIN | R&B/URBAN
If you have not heard her name yet you might have been out of Earth for the last few months. The second album of this stand-out Spanish artist is already a top 10 in many 2018-lists all around. Flamenco roots and contemporary urban sounds build up a whole unique imaginary inspired by an 11th century novel. *El mal querer* can already be declared a masterpiece.

## SMERZ
### NORWAY | ELECTRONIC
They were recommended to attend a music school after high school despite not having played any music before. Now signed to XL Recordings, the duo behind **Smerz** expresses their feelings through this experimental pop with dreamy air, ideal to be enjoyed at home with a glass of wine.
