These are the **19 emerging artists** we enjoyed the most during Eurosonic Noorderslag in Groningen (The Netherlands) between January 16th-20th 2019.

Before starting to read, we encourage you to press play to our **[Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/i91fckpcnsww16jtw3madndx7/playlist/3BpcIVYRptNnSPYylvdmAc?si=iqL6KnhLR6yvFG94TTww8w)** of the festival. 

## ALBIN LEE MELDAU
His guitar, an earnest face and barely a couple of words addressed to the audience. Probably the Ceremony of the Music Moves Europe Awards, with people muttering and walking around, was not the best setting to appreciate his sweet music. Regardless, Albin walked on stage as a reserved intellectual singer-songwriter and made an impression with two of the tracks of his debut album *About You* (2018). We may have to get back to him. 

## AMANDA TENFJORD
The half-Greek half-Norwegian singer appeared on stage denoting a confident attitude, and her amazing voice rapidly became the main protagonist of the show. Despite the fact that Amanda and her bandmates put on a really consistent performance, our first impression was that the audience didn’t respond back accordingly, as the atmosphere lacked a bit of that euphoria that can make of a concert an unforgettable one. In defense of the crowd, it’s relevant to take into account that three out of the seven tracks she performed hadn’t been released yet. We strongly believe this is just the beginning of Amanda’s promising career.

## BISHOP BRIGGS
Unlike other fellow nominees, two songs were more than enough to appreciate Bishop Briggs’ huge presence and command on stage - not that emerging anymore, she’s making her way on commercial charts, playlists and festivals. Still giggly and shy when she wasn’t singing, she rapidly transformed into a restless talented artist showing off her fierce vocals.  

## BOY AZOOGA
The Plato Record Store was packed with people waiting for the free showcase of one of the most expected names of Eurosonic 2019. Boy Azooga radiated as much happiness for this as they seem to intrinsically transmitted it as a band. *’Warm music for cold times’*, as said by a dear Dutch friend we met at the store. Frontman Davey Newington smiled optimistically and illustrated the audience with the clear vibe he intends to spread. 

## EUT
Full-housed both at Plato and The Barn, EUT seemed to be the Dutch band we could not miss at this edition. None of the two gigs proved wrong. Indeed, it was an absolute pleasure to admire EUT’s frontwoman on stage with such physical power and vocal confidence. Megan de Klerk and her bandmates certainly looked like a professional band who’s built a long music career. Not a bad compliment at all if we take into consideration their short age and discography… for now. 

## FONTAINES D.C.
Four band members do their soundcheck at Plato Record Store. Then Grian Chatten comes on stage, tries a few ‘1, 2, 3’ and the band is ready to start. Chatten moves anxiously, bites his nails and touches his trousers’ pockets while he sings. He stares at the audience fixedly, always looking a little bit haunted. You may enjoy Fontaines D.C.’s  forceful music to a greater or lesser degree, but their *possessed* frontman is the man you won’t be able to stop looking at. 

## IRIS GOLD
Having only heard *’poppier’ All I Really Know* before, it was a kind surprise to enter Huize Maas and find Iris Gold’s fantastic groove on stage. All dressed in yellow (and pink on the following morning at Plato Record Store), she exhibited wonderful diva moves, vocals and presence. Joined by a trumpet, a bass and a drums players, the gig was all about the musical blend Iris grew up with in hippie Christiania, Copenhagen. They made the Dutch audience clap, sign, dance, and above all, admire happiness and joy for life.

## KAWALA
Is it too obvious that we’ve fallen in love with Kawala? We had already adored their tracks, now we can’t take their live concert out of our heads. We ran under the rain not to miss the gig, and once we entered Lutherse Kerk we forgot about the world outside. Their singular looks don’t really match the music they later exhibit, which certainly cause a first ill-defined impression about them. Yet then they dance, they joke around, they apologise for Brexit and, most importantly, they perform an absolute progressing setlist with defined solid harmonic voices that increase our love for their music. The acoustics of the setting could not help better. Kawala are here to stay.

## LOVA
The clash on Saturday night was real, and we could only stay for a couple of her songs. She may have lacked some of the confidence she displays in her lyrics - or we may have just missed the best part of her setlist. In any case, Lova’s vocal skills sounded right and maybe we’ll just need to see her again with a crowded audience providing her more conviction. 

## MIO
No more than 20 people attended this concert in a venue partly away from the city center where everything else was taking place. With only two songs released, Mio surmounted her concert with only two synths and a series of animation clips on a screen. Regardless of the missing warmth in the environment, her colourful optimistic tracks made us believe this Finnish artist still has a long way to go. 

## NAKED CAMEO
The built-up-for-the-festival venue The Barn was heavily cold and, sadly, Naked Cameo were not able to warm it up. Jackets on, you could grasp a tiny glimpse of the efforts they put into cheering the audience up. Nevertheless, they appear to be a bonded steady band and, consequently, they know how to have fun altogether. They may just need some more attitude and self-confidence.

## NICO CASAL
Interviewed four hours before the concert, he confessed to us he was worried only 7 people would show up. At 10pm, half concert on, we entered Nieuwe Kerk and got immediately transported to a whole new world - with a large audience fascinated by it already. Red and yellow lighted up the enormous windows of the church that hosted the encounter, and Nico Casal (piano), Fraser Bowles (cello) and Pablo Serrano (synths) provided an enchanting immensity to Nico’s compositions. Even if you didn’t mean to, you would have got caught. 

## PAVVLA
Pavvla thanked her audience at the Coffee Company for being so quiet and attentive during her free showcase. Indeed, peace reigned around for the 20 minutes she introduced everyone to her world of dark creatures, atmospheres and youth feelings. Only voice and guitar, she left her musicians and synths resting until their second concert that same night, and kept track of the timeline in which she wrote each song to excuse the implicit drama on her lyrics.

## PIP BLOM
They were last year’s Eurosonic new sensation and did not disappoint on this one. Pip Blom and her bandmates are energetic and enjoy being on stage showing off how cool they are. Their concert was all smiles, laughter and mutual understanding between the members, always validated by their ease skills playing. They were also probably the band we saw the most attending other concerts while drinking beers - it may be a fact that Eurosonic already feels like home for them.

## REYKJAVÍKURDAETUR
There’s no way we can describe what you feel when you see Reyjkavíkurdaetur live. We should say there are 9 women on stage who rap and sing, dance and jump, and pass the mic protagonism around. But also that they talk openly about pussies, sex and a music video showing a woman’s period being banned from the internet. Even if one only gets the topics of the songs thanks to their English introductions, everyone gets completely caught by their beats and Icelandic rhythms. It may be a bit chaotic at some points, but they’re forgiven when the concert feels like the biggest empowering party you could ever attend.

## SON MIEUX
We do our best not to compare emerging artists to other popular names, unless it is to claim that Son Mieux have found the right way to combine the ambitious, thrilling Arcade Fire atmosphere under the leadership of a captivating Dutch Alex Turner. It may not be extremely innovative but it certainly felt massive for the audience at the Noorderslag. We look forward to seeing them continue growing both within and outside the Netherlands.

## SPORTS TEAM
Sports Team won’t leave you indifferent when you see them live. Whether it’s their frontman’s spasmic moves and silent speeches off-mic, or their expressionless keyboard (and tambourine) player, it is an extremely recommended experience to live. Alex Rice leads the young six-piece with an enormous charisma and they all transmit their joy to the astonished audience. We predict a long game for the team. 

## THE MAUSKOVIC DANCE BAND
We came from Tversky’s concert and were ready to keep dancing on our last night of Eurosonic. The Mauskovic Dance Band treated the audience and offered a mesmerising rhythmic gig where no one could not help moving its feet. Cumbia, African drums and disco grooves were the flawless combination to end the night over the top.

## TVERSKY
We transported ourselves back to the 70s by going down the News Cafe’s seedy basement. Tversky managed to make us take our winter clothes off for the first time in three days as a result of the epic party they built at Eurosonic. A broken arm did not stop Alan Imar from playing synths, sax and transverse flute, and even showing his fancy groovy moves. Xavier Paradís, of course, kept up with his colleague and cheerfully swung playing keyboards. We could only see smiles on them and the audience after the concert - there may be a bright future after that night.
