310 names make up the line-up of Eurosonic Noorderslag, the showcase festival in Groningen (The Netherlands) that will take place on January 16-20th 2019. 12 acts from Spain will represent the emerging scenes in our country. Here we highlight six of them: 

ALIEN TANGO 
They are hard to classify, so we’ll just recommend you not to miss their concert at Eurosonic (or wherever you have the opportunity to see them live.) Disco music, groovy dancing moves, and a cheeky way of playing and singing about whatever they feel like to. You will definitely have a good time.

BELAKO
Rock, electronic, post-punk, electropop… Versatile is the adjective to describe them, and surprisingly, they succeed in playing any kind of genre. Belako have released an excellent third album Render Me Numb, Trivial Violence (2018) which will for sure take them ever further than they’ve already been.

NICO CASAL
Not many people in Spain may know his name, but this piano player received an Academy Award for the short film ‘Stutterer’ (2015), in which he wrote the score. After several years working as a film and advertising composer, Nico Casal is now determined to write for himself and release his own album soon. And apparently, he’s quite ‘Ready to talk’.

PAVVLA
The dark and cold atmosphere surrounding her debut album Creatures (2016) took her to a non-expected year-and-a-half tour. She now leaves her folkie guitar a little bit behind and gives more space to an electronic synth pop that joins up her personal voice traits. She’ll catch us looking.

PERRO
They confessed their third album it’s the most mature one by a still non-mature band. Yet Perro keep telling spontaneous and non-prejudiced stories with their noisy punk-ish and even tropical music. Worth a fun listen.

TVERSKY
Welcome to the 70s. Or rather to ‘1985’. Nostalgic funk and danceable rhythm mixed with the perfect bit of electronic music and even jazzy tunes. A couple of EPs’ are enough to let oneself be taken back to the best disco clubs by the hand of Tversky.
